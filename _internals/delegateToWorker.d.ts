 * DON'T CALL THIS FUNCTION EXPLICITLY. It's inserted by a transform.

 * Tries to create a worker and pass the arguments to it. Copying large graphs
 * is not very fast, but still faster than running most algorithms
 * synchronously.
 *
 * Falls back to synchronous execution if browser doesn't support workers.
 *
 * This returns a promise which gets resolved with the result sent from the
 * worker or the synchronous functions.
 *
 * @param {string} method The name on the root jsnx object to execute.
 * @param {Array} args An array of arguments to send to the worker.
 *    Some types, such as graphs, are converted to a different format first.
 * @return {Promise}
