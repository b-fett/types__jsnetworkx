/**
 * Compute the eigenvector centrality for `G`.
 *
 * Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the
 * centrality of its neighbors. The eigenvector centrality for node `i` is
 *
 * ```math
 * Ax = \lambda x
 * ```
 *
 * where `$A$` is the adjacency matrix of the graph `G` with eigenvalue
 * `$\lambda$`. By virtue of the Perron-Frobinus theorem, there is a unique and
 * positive solution if `$\lambda$` is the largest eigenvalue associated with
 * the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix `$A$`. ([2])
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * ```
 * var G = jsnx.pathGraph(4);
 * jsnx.eigenvectorCentrality(G);
 * // Map {0: 0.37, 1: 0.6, 2: 0.6, 3: 0.37}
 * ```
 *
 * ### Notes
 *
 * The measure was introduced by ([1][]).
 *
 * The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method and has
 * no guarantee of convergence. The iteration will stop after `maxIter`
 * iterations or an error tolerance of `numberOfNodes(G) * tol` has been
 * reached.
 *
 * For directed graphs this is "left" eigenvector centrality which corresponds
 * to the in-edges in the graph. For out-edges eigenvector centrality
 * first reverse the graph with `G.reverse()`.
